Stopping with this because I don't have time - hopefully somebody else can continue it.




## Features:

- Scroll and zoom on swipe.
- Slides far away appear darker.


- There's picking functionality (disabled), in order to make the slides selectable. It doesn't work well, I think because of missing Z-Order checks.
Picking basic functionality was taken from http://android-raypick.blogspot.de/2012/04/first-i-want-to-state-this-is-my-first.html
- There's also functionality to render views (any Android layout), as textures on the slides. 
- And finally, there's functionality to download used images from the web. For some reason the slides show black on some devices. I haven't checked why.
But under certain circunstances, this works, believe me!

These can be enabled uncommenting some easy to find lines in the code.



## Dependency:

Because of the image loader, the project requires the universal image loader library, which can be downloaded from:
